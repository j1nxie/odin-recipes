	<h2 class="header">Description</h2>
	<p>Don't call the Chinese takeaway - make your own egg fried rice! Use leftover rice, or cook and dry it on a plate before using it so it doesn't stick to the wok.</p>
	<h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li>250g long grain rice</li>
	    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
	    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
	    <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
	    <li>2 spring onions, sliced, to serve</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="header">Steps</h2>
	<ol>
	    <li>cook the rice, spread out to steam-dry and set aside.</li>
	    <li>heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large wok over a high heat, then add the onion and fry until lightly browned for around 5 mins.
		add the rice, stir and toast for about 3 mins, then move to the side of the pan.</li>
	    <li>add the remaining oil, then tip in the egg mixture. Leave to cook a little, then mix in with the rice - stir vigorously to coat
		the grains or, if you prefer the egg chunkier, allow to set for a little longer before breaking up and stirring through.
		tip into a serving bowl and scatter over the spring onion to serve.</li>
	</ol>
